This template creates the following resources:

*ContractorsGroup*: An IAM group named "Contractors."
*DemoUser*: An IAM user named "DemoUser."
*DemoUserGroupMembership*: Adds the DemoUser to the ContractorsGroup.
*ContractorsPolicy*: A policy attached to the ContractorsGroup that allows access to EC2, S3, and EKS resources.
Note that the policy in this template provides full access (ec2:*, s3:*, and eks:*) to all resources (Resource: "*") within EC2, S3, and EKS. You may want to refine the policy further based on your specific requirements.
